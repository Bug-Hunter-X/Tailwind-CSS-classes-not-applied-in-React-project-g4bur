# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied in React Project

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes appear to be correctly included in a React project, but the styling they define does not get applied in the browser. The root cause, as explained in the solution, often involves missing or incorrectly configured build steps.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a simple React component using Tailwind CSS classes.  Despite the presence of these classes, the component renders without any Tailwind styling applied. The project appears to build without errors, leading to a confusing debugging experience.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to resolve this issue by ensuring that Tailwind's postcss processing is correctly integrated into the build process. This usually involves configuring a build tool like Webpack or Vite to correctly process Tailwind's directives.
